{% details(summary="What are matches and how do I use them?") %}
Matches are used for automatically navigating to archived versions of pages depending on the URLs.
They can be added in the extension settings. For more information, see 'How do I change the extension settings?'.
{% end %}

{% details(summary="What is the syntax used for matches?") %}
Matches are JavaScript regexes created using the <code>RegExp</code> class.
They are modified to match the entire URL, so surrounding the regex with <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> is not necessary.
For more information about regexes, see the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) on them.
